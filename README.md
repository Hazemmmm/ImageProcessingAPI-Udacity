The API offers one endpoint to access and resize images available in the `public/images/full` folder.

The endpoint is `api/images` and requires three query params:

| Query Param |                                     Value                                     |
| ----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| filename    | the filename (without extension) of one of the images available in the folder |
| height      |                        it should be a positive integer                        |
| width       |                        it should be a positive integer                        |
